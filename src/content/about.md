title: "About Scripture Scribbles"
---

Scripture Scribbles exists as a space to share thoughts, reflections, and studies as I explore the Bible and my faith. 

A key part of this project is *learning in public* — sharing what I’m still working through, even when my ideas may change over time. I believe there’s value in studying, applying, and sharing what I learn.

If you have thoughts, questions, or suggestions, I’d love to hear from you.
